i will supply you with an html file. this is from a property for rent listing website called net imoveis.
my goal is to have all properties listed (from all pages) saved as a json following the below schema.
i will use puppeteer to load the page and perform the following:
- go through the listing and obtain all properties information
- go through all pages
- return a json array with the properties listed
generate the pupeteer code in typescript that will perform this task.
type schema = {
  link: string;
  title: string;
  bedrooms: number;
  area: number;
  bathrooms: number;
  price: number;
  iptu: number;
  condominio: number;
  totalPrice: number;
  location: string;
  datePosted: string;
  origin: string;
};
