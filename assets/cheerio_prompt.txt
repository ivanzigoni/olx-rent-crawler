i will supply you an html file for a website that lists properties for rent, listed and paginated.
i plan to scrape all properties listed and save them as json
i need you to create code using the cheerio javascript library to achieve this task
the code must:
- start with a baseUrl which will be the first page of the listing
- manage pagination and go through all pages
- accumulate all properties listed on an array following the type below
- log this array to the console
each object should be modelled with the following type:
{
    "link": string,
    "title": string,
    "rooms": number,
    "area": number,
    "bathrooms": number,
    "price": string,
    "oldPrice": string | null,
    "iptu": string,
    "condominio":string,
    "location": string,
    "datePosted":string,
}
