i will supply you with an html file. this is from a property for rent listing website called olx.
my goal is to have all properties listed (from all pages) saved as a json.
i will use puppeteer to load the page and perform the following:
- go through the listing and obtain all properties information
- go through all pages
- return a json array with the properties listed
generate the pupeteer code that will perform this task.
the returned objects must follow this example:
    {
        "link": "https://mg.olx.com.br/belo-horizonte-e-regiao/imoveis/apto-1-quarto-270-m-da-contorno-1415712296",
        "title": "Apto 1 quarto 270 m da Contorno ",
        "rooms": 1,
        "area": 30,
        "bathrooms": 1,
        "price": "1250",
        "oldPrice": "R$ 1.350",
        "iptu": "39",
        "condominio": "285",
        "location": "Belo Horizonte, Santa Tereza",
        "datePosted": "28 de jun, 19:08"
    },
and any values that cant be found in the page should be left as an empty string
