i will supply you with an html file. this is from a property for rent listing website called viva real.
my goal is to have all properties listed (from all pages) saved as a json.
i will use puppeteer to load the page and perform the following:
- go through the listing and obtain all properties information
- go through all pages
- return a json array with the properties listed
generate the pupeteer code that will perform this task.
