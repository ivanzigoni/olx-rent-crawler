i will provide you an object schema for a json array i have stored. the array contains a list of properties for rent that i scraped
i need to display this json array on the browser through an html table. i need the table to have pagination and that all numeric filters are sortable.
i need you to generate a typescript function that does the following, in order to achieve the task:
- loads the json file
- dinamically builds the html that will fulfill the task
- saves the html file 

schema:
{
        "link": string
        "title": string
        "rooms": number,
        "area": number,
        "bathrooms": number,
        "price": number,
        "iptu": number,
        "condominio": number,
        "location": string,
        "datePosted": string
}
