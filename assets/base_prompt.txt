i will supply you with an html file. this is from a property for rent listing website called net imoveis. this html is from a page with the property details.
my goal is to have all properties listed (from all pages) saved as a json following the below schema.
i will traverse the listing using puppeteer and for each property i will follow the detail pages link. that is when the supplid html will appear
i need you to write code that go through that html and extracts information following the below schema.
if there is an information required by the schema but not present in the page, set it as an empty string or 0 if its a number
type schema = {
  link: string;
  title: string;
  bedrooms: number;
  area: number;
  bathrooms: number;
  price: number;
  iptu: number;
  condominio: number;
  totalPrice: number;
  location: string;
  datePosted: string;
  origin: string;
};
